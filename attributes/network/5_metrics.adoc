= Metrics Attribute (#6)
:cddl: ./cddl/

Similar to events, metrics are a crosscutting attribute that is impacted by every other attributes.
Any attributes can define metrics name, and some metrics can be custom for a specific network.

For example, the ledger attribute adds a metric named `[2, 0]` which contains the number of accounts the ledger has (with non-zero balance).
A network might choose to expose or not that metric.
